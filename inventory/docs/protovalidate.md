# Working with protovalidate

[protovalidate](https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate/)

See the webpage for this tool for the specific validation methods
available. The re2 syntax used in regular expressions is at [here](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax).

To learn how to leverage such library, see the [validator](../pkg/validator/) pkg.
